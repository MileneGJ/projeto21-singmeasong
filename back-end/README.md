## üèÅ Running the application

This Api can be used in two different ways: by cloning the project or by running in your preferred client, such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).

To clone the project, run the following command:

```git
git clone https://github.com/MileneGJ/projeto21-singmeasong.git
```

Then, navigate to the project folder and run the following command:

```git
npm install
```

Finally, start the server:

```git
npm start
```

You can now access the API's endpoints by navigating to `http://localhost:5000/`.
